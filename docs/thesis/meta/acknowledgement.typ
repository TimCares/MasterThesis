    I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Volker Ahlers, for his support and advice throughout the
    research presented in this thesis. I am especially thankful for his openness to my proposal for the topic of this thesis,
    which allowed me to explore a field I am passionate about. I would also like to thank my second examiner, Professor Adrian Pigors,
    for agreeing to examine this thesis and, as was the case in my Bachelor's thesis, providing feedback through his expertise in
    the field.

    I would like to deeply thank my brother Luca, my sister Anna-Lena, and my parents Anja and Michael for their continuous support
    throughout the 6 months I worked on this thesis. Their encouragement and reassurance were essential for me
    to complete this work, as I found it very challenging and difficult at times.

    I am also very grateful to Amin Kiani, who was my supervisor during my time at Continental,
    for his support and advice on how to approach new, challenging topics
    in an academic context. Especially his advice to start
    simple and incrementally increase the complexity has stuck with me throughout this work, and helped me to reach the
    results presented in this thesis.

    Lastly, I am very grateful to all the researches that published the code to the papers this thesis is based on.
    The code allowed me to get a deeper understanding of their methods, and helped me to integrate their ideas into my own work,
    which would have been significantly more challenging otherwise.
    Because of this, I would like to give a special thanks to the authors of BEIT-3, VLMo, CLIP, and FLAVA.
