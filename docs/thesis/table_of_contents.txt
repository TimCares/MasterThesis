		Reproducing SHRe
		Aligned Representations
			Supervised Teacher
				Larger Batch Sizes with DDP
				Multimodal Transformer Block
			Self-Supervised Teacher
			Contrastive Learning
				On Zero-Shot Retrieval
				Short Captions (Region Descriptions)
				Projections for Task-Seperation
				Image-Text Matching with Feature-Fusion
				Increasing Negative Examples for ITC
				
			Token-Type Embedding (Also try without layerscale)
			Unimodal-2-Multimodal Projection
			Target Cross-Modal Late Interaction
				Cross-Modal Late Interaction
				Method
				(Empty Target)
			Object-Level Regression
				Contrastive Target Loss (each teacher target is a class -> not 1000 classes, but 256 or 512, each being the cls token of one image passed to the teacher)
				Dimensionality Reduction (lin projection on both, teacher proj in ema of student proj)
				Discussing Feature Clusters
				Quantizing Visual Features
			Loss Ablation Studies
				Removing ITC
				Removing Teacher
			Self-Distillation (Dino Loss)
				
			Biased VL Initialization (init from text)
			Fair Comparison with Supervised Teacher (bigger supervised teacher -> approx. 85 mill params)
			Importance of the right Teacher (why BEiT-2? etc...) (D2V2 Image, BEiT-3, Dino, )
			Non-Knowledge-Distaillation (motivation -> application of kd very limited, especially with unimodal model)
				Remove ITC? and do finetuning?
			Limitations (from trained models alone: No NRLV2, etc possible) -> mention https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03334 section 2.1 beginning page 3
		
		Aligned Referencing Representations
			Relevance (regarding: unimodal model as teacher no possible)
			Masked Vision-Language Modeling
			Additional Contribution: DistilBEiT-3

		Ablation Study: Reduction of Data (Mulitple reductions and plot retrieval and zero shot)
		
		
Conclusion
Outlook (Same vs. different pos encoding ^*, can architectures be mixed?, add other modalities, especially audio + add audio)

Architectural Studies
	Mixed Positional Encodings (defaults with pretrained D2V modules, include Token-Type Embeddings!)
	Shared Positional Encodings
